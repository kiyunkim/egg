CHANGELOG:

- A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF (<v0.21)

  - Save
  - Load

v 0.22:
  - Offline mode (save timestamp of last save so that on load calculate what should have been done)

v 0.23:

- Change save/load messages to not be coupled to save/load functions
  - have calling functions log
  - Autosave (5 minute duration default, 1 minute minimum)

sharks
rays
crabs
fish
sand
science
crystal
kelp
sea apple - can be used for a science boost
sharkonium


DONE: [xenobiology] buy science with sea apples
DONE: [transmutation] buy sharkonium with crystal and sand

DONE: fish -> crab -> crystal (very slow) 

DONE: crystals + sharks -> science shark -> science
[regular biology] shark + lots of fish -> nurse shark -> sharks
[laser tech] crystals + rays -> laser ray -> -sand +crystals
[sea apples] sand + crab -> planter crab -> kelp

[automation] crystals + sand + sharkonium -> crystalminer -> +crystals (higher than crabs)
[automation] crystals + sharkonium -> autotransmuter -> -crystals +sharkonium
[automation] sharkonium -> fishmachine -> +fish (higher than sharks)




science:

- crystal bite-gear - shark multiplier x 2
- crystal spades - ray multiplier x 2
- crystal containers - science shark multiplier x 2
    - underwater chemistry - science shark multiplier x 2

    - seabed geology - rays multiplier x 2
        - thermal vents
            - laser rays - enable laser rays
            - automation - enable expensive but better structures
                - engineering - crystalminer x 2, autotransmuter x 2, fishmachine x 2
        - kelp horticulture - enable planter crabs
            - xenobiology - enable converting sea apples to science
                - regular biology - enable nurse sharks
            - sun observation - planters x 2

(thermal vents) (underwater chemistry)
    - transmutation - allows conversion of crystal to sharkonium

(seabed geology) (sun observation)
    - exploration - shark multiplier x 1.5, ray multiplier x 1.5
        - far exploration - crab multiplier x 3
			- gate exploration





                !!!!!!!!!!!!DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



				

v 0.48

Things to do: 
apply Dylan's fix, 
	change line 59 of ascii85 to (bytes.charCodeAt(i+3))) >>> 0;
reduce big costs by an order of magnitude or so, 
add "buy 10", "buy 1/3 max" and "buy 1/2 max" buttons
display research effects on research buttons,
display effectiveness multipliers in income table (after amount, before rate), 
provide better cost calculation: rather than have the calculation be a function, set costs to be based on constant or linear and call appropriate functions from cost lookup table?
add crab and ray generators and required tech
consolidate options pane and other panes into one generic pane!

UNUSED POSSIBLE FUTURE STUFF


v World

    - World tab
        - assemble squads from resources!
            - this should be handled automatically, if a squad is needed in a place and one isn't on the way one gets sent
        - select territories to send squads to!
            - choose what sort of squads to send??
        - living world - everything else moves on a timer!
        - home base can never be destroyed
        - other factions cannot have more than three bases

    - combat plans:
    - squads have a faction, a strength, a health and possibly a special feature (implemented via function)
    - factions have bases and squad types (pick random appropriate animal??)
    - bases

    - Gate tab (have it be able to be activated on discovery)

    ~ MOSTLY COMPLETE ~

v Terrain
    - terrains
        - ocean (bluh)
        - caves (attacking squads have strength reduced by 1)
        - chasms (special encounters, occupying squads have health reduced by 1 each tick)
        - fish school (bonus to fish income while occupied)
        - crystals (bonus to tech income while occupied??)

v Chasms
    - get to chasms to fight ancient mechanical abyss creatures (non-diplomatic faction) and collect crystalline fish
    - gate requires some crystalline fish to activate
    - activating gate ends game!
